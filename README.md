## Building & Running

To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task              | Description      |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `./gradlew test`  | Run the tests    |
| `./gradlew build` | Build everything |
| `./gradlew run`   | Run application  |

To run the application, you can also call `main` from [
`Application.kt`](./src/main/kotlin/cz/cvut/fit/atlasest/application/Application.kt)
