# Multi Format Mock Server

## Building & Running

To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task              | Description      |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `./gradlew test`  | Run the tests    |
| `./gradlew build` | Build everything |
| `./gradlew run`   | Run application  |

To run the application, you can also call `main` from [
`Application.kt`](./src/main/kotlin/cz/cvut/fit/atlasest/application/Application.kt)

## Collections

The collections are defined in the `db.json` file.

## JSON schema

Use JSON schema from file by adding the `-s` flag with the filename as value (currently there is only support for [Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12#draft-2020-12)).

If no schema file will be provided, the JSON schema will be inferred from the collections.

## OpenAPI specification

When the server is running, the generated OpenAPI specification will be available at `/$rootPath/openapi.json` and
SwaggerUI will be available at `/$rootPath/swagger-ui`.

## Docker
 The [`CI/CD pipeline`](.gitlab-ci.yml) automatically builds and pushed the image to Docker Hub. The image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/atlasest/multi-format-mock-server/general). To use Docker, make sure you have it installed. You can follow the official installation guides based on your operating system:

* **Linux**: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
* **Windows**: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
* **MacOS**: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/
* An alternative for Linux and MacOS is [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)

### Pull image from Docker Hub
To pull image from Docker Hub and run as container run the following commands:

| Command                                                     | Description                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `docker pull atlasest/multi-format-mock-server`             | Pull the image from Docker Hub |
| `docker run -p 8080:8080 atlasest/multi-format-mock-server` | Run container                  |

### Building and running Docker image locally

To build and run the Docker image locally use the following commands:

| Command                                            | Description            |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `docker build -t multi-format-mock-server .`       | Build the Docker image |
| `docker run -p 8080:8080 multi-format-mock-server` | Run container          |
 
### Mounting local files to Docker container
The Docker image includes some example data and default configuration. To mount local files (
[`db.json`](db.json), [`identifiers.json`](identifiers.json), [`application.yaml`](src/main/resources/application.yaml)) when running container add the --volume flag.

`--volume <volume-name>:<mount-path>`

For example with `db.json`:

`--volume ./db.json:/app/db.json`

### Running Docker container with custom JSON schema

To run the container with a custom schema the schema file must be mounted and the container must be run with the `-s` flag.

`docker run -p 8080:8080  --volume ./schema.json:/app/schema.json <image-tag> -s schema.json`

### Docker Compose

The repository includes [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). This file can be used to run the application's Docker image. The file also includes commented-out volume mounting as well as the custom schema option, to use these just uncomment them and edit as needed. To get started, make sure you have Docker Compose installed ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)), then run:

```shell
    docker-compose up
```

### Note for MacOS Sequoia 15.2 users:

When building the image locally on MacOS Sequoia 15.2 there is a [bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345296) in JVM, for which the workaround is to add `ENV JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-XX:UseSVE=0"` to **each stage** in the Dockerfile. This disables SVE usage in the JVM. A more detailed explanation can be found ([here](https://medium.com/@luketn/java-on-docker-sigill-exception-on-mac-os-sequoia-15-2-9311e4775442)). The Dockerfile already includes this fix as commented-out linesâ€”you can simply uncomment them as needed.
